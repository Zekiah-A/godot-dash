A Geometry Dash remake in Godot Engine.
**The 3.5 branch is now deprecated.**
I will try to add as much documentation as possible.

## How to play the game

Head to the releases section and download the latest one.

## Installation Instructions

**⚠️ Make sure to use Godot 4.0. For the Godot 3.5 legacy version, change branch. ⚠️**

- Clone the repo locally or download the source code as a zip from the releases.
- Import the project.godot file (if you cloned the repo) or the source code zip (if you downloaded it from the releases).
