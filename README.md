A Geometry Dash remake in Godot Engine.

I will try to add as much documentation as possible.

## Installation Instructions

**⚠️ Make sure that you're using Godot 3.5 because Godot 4.0 isn't supported at the moment. ⚠️**

- Clone the repo locally or download the source code as a zip from the releases.
- Import the project.godot file (if you cloned the repo) or the source code zip (if you downloaded it from the releases).
